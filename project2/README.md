Project 2: Artifical neural network
===================================
My goal is to create an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that can be 
used both for regression and classification problems. This is a very 
interesting topic, and I had a lot of fun (and headache) while working
with these codes. Feel free to use them on your own, while I encourage
anyone who does so to try and find the hidden errors. Consider them sort
of easter eggs, and I'll consider your contribution(s) acts of kindness.

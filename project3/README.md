Project 3: Pattern recognition
==============================

The documentation can be found [here](https://johancarlsen.github.io/fys-stk4155/html/project3.html).

For my final project, I write my own classification tree code, and use 
it toghether with the neural network and logistic regression codes to 
classify handwritten digits between 0 and 9.

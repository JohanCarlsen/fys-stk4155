# FYS-STK4155
This repository contains the numerical work done by me (Johan Carlsen)
during the course. I have created a public documentation of the 
contents [here](https://johancarlsen.github.io/fys-stk4155/html/index.html#).

In the first project, the task is to create a model using the Ordinary
Least Squares (OLS), Ridge, and Lasso regression methods and compare it
to real-life topological data.

Cheers!
